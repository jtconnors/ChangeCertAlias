Sample run of application
-------------------------

This NetBeans project includes a simple keystore called my.jks. It has one
self-signed certificate where its associated alias contains a weird character.
In this case it's:

   "jim?s self-signed cert"

The '?' character is actually represented in hexadecimal as '\u0219'.

Step 1: Use keytool to print the alias

C:\tmp\ChangeCertAlias>keytool -keystore my.jks -list
Enter keystore password: changeit
Keystore type: jks
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry

jim?s self-signed cert, Aug 14, 2018, PrivateKeyEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (SHA1): D6:24:1F:4B:82:ED:B5:83:BC:67:89:CA:14:AE:12:7F:
CB:F4:0F:B1


Step 2: Run the ChangeCertAlias program to modify the alias.  In this case
we'll get rid of the '\u2019' character.  The program will prompt the user for
input.  Passwords for the sample key and keystore are the same: "changeit".

C:\tmp\ChangeCertAlias>java -jar dist\ChangeCertAlias.jar

Keystore file: my.jks
Enter keystore password: changeit

Aliases in my.jks
        1: jim?s self-signed cert
Select an alias number: 1
Enter the new certificate alias: jims self-signed cert
Name of new keystore file: new.jks
Enter key password: changeit
New keystore: new.jks created with updated alias: "jims self-signed cert"


Step 3: Use Keytool to verify the new keystore contains a modified alias.

C:\tmp\ChangeWeirdCertAlias>keytool -keystore new.jks -list
Enter keystore password:
Keystore type: jks
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry

jims self-signed cert, Aug 14, 2018, PrivateKeyEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (SHA1): D6:24:1F:4B:82:ED:B5:83:BC:67:89:CA:14:AE:12:7F:
